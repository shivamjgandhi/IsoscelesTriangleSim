# IsosceleseTriangleSim

This is the simulator for random packings of isosceles triangles. You can specify the amount of triangles you want to pack and the main 
angle for the triangles. 

The purpose of this software is to analyze the orientations of random packings and correlate the angles of the triangles to the various
orientations that occur in random packings. It is hypothesized that the geometry of certain molecules that can be modeled using these
isosceles triangles contributes to their transition into a triatic phase between the nematic and liquid crystal phase.
